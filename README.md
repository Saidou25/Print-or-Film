## Description
This web app is built with the intention that users can narrow down which version of a book to read before they watch a movie inspired by said book. Users will start with a simple search (with best advice being to search for the movie title) and be presented with a movie closest to their search. Below the movie will be a collection of related books, ranked in order by GoogleBooks user reviews. App users may then use a wishlist button for each book and/or movie they wish to review. These choices will be saved via local storage and kept in a wishlist for the user.
